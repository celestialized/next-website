                        <p>Subscription management starts from creating plans that have one or more people who want to avail the service and pay for the usage on a recurring basis.</p>

                        <p>It involves creating plans, defining pricing model and then adding users and generating billing based on the defined pricing model and actual consumption.</p>

                        <p>Companies of all sizes face the question of whether to build or buy a billing solution. Cashfree Subscription Management Software powers you to enable recurring payment schedule, control the billing cycle and get instant alerts on subscription activity. All you have to do is to link a plan to the customer and Cashfree takes care of the rest.</p>

                        <p>The service is available as a Dashboard feature and as API.</p>
